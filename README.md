a basic neural network
its probably bad

edit: it is bad but it works

TODO:
    -- add saving and loading models from files (prob not csv)
    -- training algorithm optimization
    -- e.g. dynamic learning rate with momentum
    -- validation loss & accuracy

Long term goals: 
    -- network visualization + data visualization
    -- support for classification tasks (right now its just regression)
    -- convolutions
    -- multithreading (+gpu acceleration)
    -- ^^ dataset batching
    -- support for multiple optimizers
    -- ik its bad but natural selection & evolution as an optimizer is fun
    -- man i want an ai to play like snake or something
